Dataset: M4 forecasting competition
===================================

This Python package contains the dataset from the 
M4 (Makridakis-4) time series forecasting competition.

Data was taken from their site: 
https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/

Later versions might do a load-on-first-time from an 
online link, however this version comes pre-packaged 
with the data.


Installation
------------
Clone this repository, then run: 
`python setup.py install`

This will probably be distributed on PyPI in the 
near future.
